# Amazon Bestseller Analysis

Sales figures are some of the most important sets of data in any retail business. This is because investing in sales data analysis could lead to trend insights, future sales, and increased revenue. In this project, we visualize sales data for the largest online retailers in the world, Amazon.com. With D3 visualization, we reveal pertinent trends to Amazonâ€™s business, such as their best selling products, best selling categories, and what kinds of products are predicted to generate the most revenue based on their sales to review ratio.
